# FlavorVerse Recipe App

Source code for react/node FlavorVerse Recipe App

## Setup an edamam account

You'll need to create a cloudinary account [https://www.edamam.com/](https://www.edamam.com/) - there is a free tier,
Then you make an Application of Recipe Search API.

## Start the server

* Clone the repo
* In the root folder, create a new file called .env. In here, add your edamam connection details e.g:

```
  REACT_APP_EDAMAM_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
  REACT_APP_EDAMAM_API_ID={YOUR_API_ID}
```

* You can get this from your Edamam dashboard after signing up. **Avoid checking these details into a public repo - this is effectively your username and password so keep them safe! :) **
* Open a terminal and run the following from the root(FlavorVerse) folder:

```
  npm install
  npm start
```

* You can check its working by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in Postman or Chrome.
* The app should be running on localhost:3000
